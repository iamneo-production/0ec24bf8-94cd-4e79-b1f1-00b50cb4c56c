# Online Aadhaar Portal

The Online Aadhaar Portal is a secure and user-friendly platform that provides individuals with easy access to their Aadhaar-related services and information. The portal is designed with a React.js frontend and powered by a robust Spring Boot backend, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.


## Key Features

* User Authentication: The portal incorporates a strong user authentication system to ensure the privacy and security of sensitive Aadhaar data. Users can log in securely using their Aadhaar number and a unique OTP (One-Time Password) sent to their registered mobile number.

* Aadhaar Services: Once logged in, users can access a wide range of Aadhaar services, such as updating personal information (address, mobile number, email), linking Aadhaar to various government schemes, and applying for a new Aadhaar card.

* Real-time Updates: The portal leverages Spring Boot's real-time capabilities to provide users with immediate updates on their Aadhaar application status, making the entire process quick and transparent.

* Document Upload: Users can securely upload necessary documents directly through the portal. The backend, powered by Spring Boot, efficiently manages and validates these uploads to ensure accuracy and completeness.

* Notifications and Alerts: Users receive timely notifications and alerts about important updates, such as successful profile updates, applications approvals, or requests for further action.

* Privacy and Security: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to enhance privacy and security in the Online Aadhaar Portal by providing a secure and stateless authentication mechanism, ensuring that users' identities are verified and their access to resources is authorized.
